# Number Classification API - HNG DevOps Stage one
![api](./img/numerical-api.jpg)

A simple API that classifies a given number based on its mathematical properties and provides a fun fact using Number API

### Features
✅ Accepts a number as a query parameter
✅ Returns mathematical properties (prime, perfect, Armstrong, even/odd)
✅ Fetches a fun fact about the number
✅ Returns data in JSON format
✅ Handles invalid inputs gracefully
✅ Supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

### Tech Stack

- Python (Flask) - API Development
- Flask-CORS - Handling Cross-Origin requests
- Requests - Fetching fun facts from Numbers API
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu) - Deployment
- GitHub - Version Control

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Install Python 3 and Virtual Environment (Local PC - Ubuntu/Linux)
Before writing the API, I first ensured Python 3 was installed on my local machine. 
To check if python is installed, run:

> python3 --version

If Python is not installed, install it using:

> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv

#### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Local PC)
A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated. I created one with:

> python3 -m venv number-classify-env
> source number-classify-env/bin/activate

#### 3. Install Flask and Dependencies (Local PC)
Inside the virtual environment, I installed the required libraries:

> pip install flask flask-cors requests

#### 4. Write the Python Script for the API (Local PC)
I created a new file called app.py and wrote the code, which is attached to this repository.

#### 5. Test the API Locally
I ran the Flask app using:

> python3 app.py

The API was accessible at:

> http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/classify-number?number=251

I tested different numbers to ensure the classification and fun fact retrieval were working properly.

#### 6. Push the Code to GitHub
I created a public GitHub repository, then ran the following commands to push my code:

> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m "Initial commit"
> git branch -M main
> git remote add origin https://github.com/tejirih/number-classification-api.git
> git push -u origin main

### Deployment on AWS EC2

#### 1. Launch an EC2 Instance
I created an Ubuntu 20.04 EC2 instance on AWS.
Allowed SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) in security groups.
Connected via SSH:

> ssh -i <your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>

#### 2. Install Python and Dependencies on EC2
I updated the system and installed Python 3:

> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
> sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv git nginx

#### 3. Clone the GitHub Repository on EC2

> git clone https://github.com/tejirih/number-classification-api.git
> cd number-classification-api

#### 4. Set Up Virtual Environment on EC2

> python3 -m venv number-classify-env
> source number-classify-env/bin/activate
> pip install flask flask-cors requests

#### 5. Run the API on EC2

>python3 app.py

I accessed the API using:

> http://13.60.28.101:5000/api/classify-number?number=4

#### 6. Set up a Reverse Proxy with Nginx
To make the API publicly accessible, I configured Nginx:

> sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

and updated it as seen below

```
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

I saved and restarted nginx.

> sudo systemctl restart nginx

#### 7. Testing invalid inputs
I tested invalid input such as alphabet and error response (400 Bad request) as intended with the below error message, confirming the code working as intended.
> http://13.60.28.101:5000/api/classify-number?number=cat

### Final Notes
This API is successfully implemented using Flask and supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It achieves a response time of less than 500ms, ensuring efficient performance. The API handles errors gracefully, returning a 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs and a 200 OK response for valid integers. With all requirements met, this project is considered successfully completed.
